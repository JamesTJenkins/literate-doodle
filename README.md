Crimsion Catacombs is a small horror game made with Unity 6 where the player is searching for the Book of Death by doing a series of puzzles to get deeper into the crypt while avoiding its feared crypt keeper.

<h2>
Why project called 'literate-doodle'?
</h2>
<p>
Im not one for creating names for games before even making them so I enjoy using the randomly generated ones github provides.
</p>
<h2>
I can't clone the project?
</h2>
<p>
Unfortunatly if I uploaded art assets to github i'd run out of lfs space from doing multiple projects and start getting billed for it so the files are stored on my own personal server. While the code you can freely preview you just wont be able to preview the art assets created for this project or try out the project within Unity.
